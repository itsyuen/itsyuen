Hello! I'm Peter I-Tsyuen Chang 張以全
I am currently working as a Assitant Professor at Taiwan Tech (National Taiwan University of Science and Technology)
Mechanical Engineering Department, researching in Control Engineering, Mechatronics and Robotics.

I code in Embedded systems, and apply all sorts of SW and real time control algorithm along with many collaborators.

I also write documents in LaTex for scientific writing, and for the purpose of all the above Code/Writing version control, I am importing all my work into GitHub as an open source development environment.
